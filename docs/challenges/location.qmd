title: "Migration of Black Americans in Georgia."
---

This plate is a map showing the migration of black Americans into and out of Georgia in 1890. On the face of it, the map is very curious --- the colours don't seem to represent anything, and the states themselves aren't labelled^[Perhaps this is an easier sell to an American audience, but I could probably only label ten at most!]. One can intuit which one is Georgia due to it being labelled in Black, with all arrows pointing towards or away from it.

The underlying data from these two maps is very simple in structure, and it would be relatively easy to create a `{gt}` table, perhaps colouring the rows using `data_color()`. But this plate made me curious --- could one create a map with `{gt}`? It wouldn't be nearly as detailed as one created with `{ggplot2}` or `{leaflet}`, but the plate doesn't seem to care for detail as much as being eye catching, so why should the table?

By borrowing the state grid from the `{geofacet}` package, I was able to use `{tidyr}` to create a data frame where the locations of the values roughly represented the geographic positions of the states. I re-used DuBois' colour scheme but used it to bin the data into quantiles, visually grouping states with similar values together.

This table also uses a strange quirk of `{gt}` --- you can put tables *inside other tables*!
