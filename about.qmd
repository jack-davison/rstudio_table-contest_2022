This website was built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), the next generation of the `{rmarkdown}` document preparation system.

One quality-of-life feature of this website is code-linking. Try clicking on package names (e.g., `{gt}`) or function names (e.g., `gt::gt()`) to be taken to their help pages. Links work both in-line and in code chunks, such as the one below.

Furthermore, code chunks can be easily copied by using the clipboard `r emoji::emoji("clipboard")` icon at the top right of the code chunk, when hovered over.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(dplyr)

starwars |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = T),
            skin_colors = n_distinct(skin_color))
```
